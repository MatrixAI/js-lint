# AGENTS
- This is the **standards source repo**. It is not a product repo and does not declare/enforce a product profile.
- Downstream product repos vendor this repo under `./.matrixai/matrixai-standards/` and keep their own repo-root `AGENTS.md` + `./.matrixai/repo-profile.yml` (see [`README.md`](README.md)).
- When editing standards, enforce the universal hotset [`standards/HOTSET.md`](standards/HOTSET.md).
- When editing templates, keep them consistent with the downstream contract documented in [`README.md`](README.md#profile-key-first-navigation-for-architecture-overlays).
- Prefer ASCII punctuation/symbols when an equivalent exists (see [`standards/HOTSET.md`](standards/HOTSET.md) [MXS-GEN-006]).
- Ensure edits comply with [`.editorconfig`](.editorconfig) (LF line endings, 2-space indent, final newline, trim trailing whitespace).
- Line-reference policy (applies to all agent-generated repository content: Markdown, docs, templates, and code comments):
  - Never emit `path:line` (e.g. `foo.ts:1`, `README.md:126`) into repository files.
  - Do NOT put `:number` inside Markdown link destinations: `[x](path:123)` is banned.
  - If a line reference is needed, use either:
    - `[x](path#heading-anchor)` (if possible), or
    - `[x](path) (line 123)` (preferred, portable), or
    - `[x](path#L123)` only when explicitly targeting a renderer that supports `#L` anchors.
  - If you would have emitted `:1`, drop it entirely: use `path` with no line info.
  - For downstream-only paths that are not present in this standards repo (e.g. product-repo files like `wrangler.toml`), use inline code instead of a Markdown link.
